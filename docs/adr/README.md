# Architecture Decision Records

## Overview

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Gemini ZIO Project. ADRs are used to document important architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. It provides a record of what was decided, why it was decided, and how it impacts the project.

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows this format:
1. **Title**: A descriptive name
2. **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, or Superseded
3. **Context**: The issue being addressed
4. **Decision**: The change being proposed
5. **Consequences**: Impact of the decision

## Index

1. [Initial Architecture](001-initial-architecture.md) - Core architectural decisions
2. _(Future ADRs will be listed here)_

## Creating New ADRs

When creating a new ADR:
1. Copy the template from `template.md`
2. Number it sequentially (e.g., 002-...)
3. Add it to this index
4. Submit it for review
