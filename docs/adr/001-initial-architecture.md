# ADR 001: Initial Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to build a chat application that interacts with Google's Gemini AI model. The application needs to be:
- Reliable and resilient
- Easy to test and maintain
- Configurable for different environments
- Extensible for future features

## Decision

We've decided to use:

1. **ZIO as Core Framework**
   - Provides robust error handling
   - Offers excellent concurrency support
   - Has built-in dependency injection (ZLayer)
   - Strong type safety and testability

2. **Layered Architecture**
   - Domain Layer: Pure data models and protocols
   - Config Layer: Type-safe configuration management
   - Client Layer: HTTP communication with Gemini API
   - Service Layer: Business logic and conversation management
   - Main Layer: Application entry point and composition

3. **Error Handling Strategy**
   - Custom error hierarchy (GeminiError)
   - Typed error channels in ZIO
   - Automatic retry for transient failures
   - Graceful degradation

4. **Testing Approach**
   - Unit tests with mocked dependencies
   - Integration tests for main flows
   - Property-based testing for data models
   - Test fixtures and helpers

## Consequences

### Positive
- Strong type safety and compile-time guarantees
- Easy dependency injection and testing
- Clear separation of concerns
- Robust error handling
- Future-proof architecture

### Negative
- Steeper learning curve for ZIO
- More boilerplate compared to simpler approaches
- Need to manage more abstractions

## Notes

- Consider monitoring and metrics in future iterations
- May need to revisit error handling for streaming responses
- Documentation needs to be maintained as architecture evolves
